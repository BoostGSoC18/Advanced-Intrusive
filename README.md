# Advanced-Intrusive
This library contains code related some of the advanced data structures useful to the modern world.

This Project adds 4 advanced data structures into the collection:-

1) Segment tree

2) Fenwick tree

3) Suffix tree

4) Suffix automata

As a part of project 2 more algorithms are also implemented.

- Heavy light decomposition

- Centroid decomposition

# Segment tree

Segment tree implemented here is basic version which supports all the basic methods.The methods are:-

-Build()
-Update()
-Query()

This also supports iterator.

# Fenwick tree

Fenwick tree implemented here is basic version which supports all the basic methods.The methods are:-

-Build()
-Update()
-Query()

This also supports iterator.This data structure can be extended by adding advanced methods.

# Suffix tree

Suffix tree is used in lot of string applications.It can solve many string based problems.The method supported by suffix tree implemented here are:-

-Build()

# Suffix automata

Suffix automata is used in lot of string applications.It can solve many string based problems.The method supported by suffix automata implemented here are:-

-Build()

# Heavy light decomposition

This is a popular type of decomposition where every node selects a heavy child thus forming chains.The important advantage is we can travel between any 2 nodes in just O(log(N)) chains.This can be used in many tree based problems.

# Centroid decomposition

This is also popular decomposition where in we recursively select centroid and remove it forming forest and then selecting centroid among those trees.This gives a tree of height O(log(N)).
